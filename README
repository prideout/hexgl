This is an emulation of Thibaut Despoulain's wonderful HexGL game, rewritten from scratch using
TypeScript and Filament.  I tilt my hat to Thibaut for his generous contribution to the community.

<!--
This is a literate racing game, written in markdown. The code blocks get extracted and glued into
a single TypeScript file. It is basically a clone of Thibaut Despoulain's wonderful HexGL using
Filament and WebGL 2.0. I tilt my hat to Thibaut for his generous contribution to the community.
