This is a rewrite of Thibaut Despoulain's HexGL racing game using TypeScript and Filament.
I tilt my ðŸŽ© to Thibaut and everyone who contributed to his project.

Before building the web app, clone the master and gh-pages branches separately as follows.

    git clone https://github.com/prideout/hexgl.git hexgl_source
    git clone -b gh-pages https://github.com/prideout/hexgl.git hexgl_public
    cd hexgl_source
    yarn install
    yarn build
    cd ../hexgl_public
    npx http-server

The master branch contains only the source code, while gh-pages contains resource files and the
output of the build.
